After you have successfully installed ComfyStream by following the [installation guide](/technical/get-started/install), you can run your first AI workflow.

## Prerequisites

Download [example workflows](https://github.com/livepeer/comfystream/tree/main/workflows/comfystream) from the ComfyStream GitHub repository to test your setup.

## Accessing ComfyStream UI

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ComfyStream UI Preview Window">
    When you click the ComfyStream node and select **ComfyStream UI Preview** in ComfyUI, it will open a window that looks similar to the image below:
    <Frame>
      ![comfystream-ui-dialog-box.png](../../images/comfystream-ui-dialog-box.png)
    </Frame>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Standalone Browser Tab">
    If you prefer to run workflows in a new tab rather than inside ComfyUI, click **Open ComfyStream UI** from the [ComfyStream Menu](/technical/get-started/install#accessing-comfystream).
    This will open a similar dialog box in a new browser tab.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Opening the UI will ask for permission to access your video and audio so it
  can stream your webcam and microphone. You need to provide access to use
  ComfyStream.
</Note>

## Running Your First Workflow

<Info>
  ComfyStream currently supports only the API workflow format. To export a
  workflow in this format, use **Workflow > Export (API)** in ComfyUI. Support
  for the native ComfyUI format is under development and will be available in a
  future release.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select your workflow">
    In the ComfyStream UI, click **Choose files** and select one of the
    previously downloaded workflows.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start ComfyStream">
    Click **Start Stream** to start the workflow. Once the stream starts, you
    will see **Starting Stream..** at the bottom of the page. Depending on the
    workflow complexity, it may take some time to start. Please wait patiently.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enjoy your stream">
    Once the stream starts, you will see the AI effects being applied in
    real-time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  everything is loading properly without any major errors.
