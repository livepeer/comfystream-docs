<Warning>
  This is an experimental feature currently available on the [obs-separate-tab
  branch](https://github.com/livepeer/comfystream/tree/obs-separate-tab). It
  will be merged into the main branch soon.
</Warning>

After setting up ComfyStream and running your first workflow, you can use OBS Studio to capture and broadcast your AI-enhanced streams to your favourite platforms — whether it's YouTube, Twitch, or distributed infrastructure providers like Livepeer.

## Prerequisites

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Install OBS Studio">
    Download and install [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) for your
    operating system. OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free and open-source
    software for video recording and live streaming.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Run ComfyStream Workflow">
    Before streaming with OBS, you need to have a running ComfyStream workflow.
    If you haven't done this yet, follow the [run your first
    workflow](/technical/get-started/quickstart#running-your-first-workflow)
    guide first.

## Setting Up OBS with ComfyStream

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the full-screen stream">
    Click the  <Icon icon="up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" />  icon in the bottom right corner of the ComfyStream video output to open the stream in a new fullscreen browser tab.
    <Accordion title="reference image">
    <Frame caption="Once your stream is live, you'll see a small icon in the bottom right corner of the video output window.">
      <img src="../../images/OBS-capture.png" />
    </Frame>
    </Accordion>
    
    <Note>
    This dedicated view provides a clean video source without any UI elements, perfect for capturing in OBS.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Copy the stream URL">
    Copy the URL from the new browser tab. You'll need this to add the stream as a source in OBS.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add browser source in OBS">
    1. Open **OBS Studio**.  
    2. In the **Sources** panel, click the **+** button.  
    3. Select **Browser** from the list of source types.  
    4. Name your source (e.g., "ComfyStream Output") and click **OK**.  
    5. Paste the URL you copied from the ComfyStream fullscreen tab into the **URL** field.  
    6. Set the **Width** and **Height** fields to **1024** to match the resolution of the ComfyStream video.  
    7. Click **OK** to confirm and add the browser source.

    <Info>
    You may need to adjust other browser source settings depending on your specific requirements and system performance.
    </Info>

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Position and scale the source">
    Once added, you can resize and position the ComfyStream browser source within your OBS scene as needed.
    
    You can also add additional sources like webcams, images, or text overlays to enhance your stream.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Streaming to Platforms

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Major Streaming Platforms">
    Use the same OBS setup to stream to platforms like:
    - YouTube Live
    - Twitch
    - Facebook Live 
    - Custom RTMP servers.

    Each platform provides a unique **stream key** and **RTMP URL**. Configure these in **OBS Settings →
    Stream** to start broadcasting.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Stream to Livepeer">
    Livepeer is a distributed video streaming network offering cost-effective
    streaming infrastructure. Follow the [Livepeer
    Documentation](https://docs.livepeer.org/developers/guides/stream-via-obs)
    for detailed instructions on how to:
    1. Create a stream on **Livepeer
    Studio**. 
    2. Configure OBS with your Livepeer **Stream Key** and **RTMP
    ingest** URL. 
    3. Start broadcasting your **ComfyStream AI-enhanced video**.
  </Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<Note>
  If you experience performance issues, try reducing the resolution or frame
  rate in both ComfyStream and OBS settings. Browser sources can be
  resource-intensive, especially with AI-generated content.
