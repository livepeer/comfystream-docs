## Introduction

The **Super Resolution** node **upscales** video frames with pre-trained models. The process leverages GPU acceleration through [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) compiled with CUDA support, ensuring exceptional speed ideal for real-time applications. When using workflows with base Stable Diffusion models optimized for **512x512**, higher resolutions can compromise efficiency and FPS. In these scenarios, a dedicated super-resolution node allows upscaling without significantly affecting performance or quality.

## Setup Method

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Docker Setup (Recommended)">
    The node is optimized for high-speed upscaling and requires OpenCV with CUDA support. By running ComfyStream with the **[Docker setup](/technical/get-started/install#install-with-docker)**, you get a precompiled package from [ComfyUI-Stream-Pack/releases](https://github.com/JJassonn69/ComfyUI-Stream-Pack/releases/tag/v1.0) included in the Docker image. This eliminates the need for manual compilation.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual Installation (Advanced)">
    If you prefer to install OpenCV with CUDA support manually, follow the guide in article [Installing OpenCV with CUDA Support](https://medium.com/@juancrrn/installing-opencv-4-with-cuda-in-ubuntu-20-04-fde6d6a0a367).This guides you through the multiple steps and prerequisites needed to successfully compile OpenCV package.
    
    You can use the following code block as a reference, modify the paths and variables to match your system.

    ```bash [expandable]
    # Clone OpenCV repositories
    git clone --depth 1 --branch 4.11.0 https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
    git clone --depth 1 --branch 4.11.0 https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git

    # Create build directory
    mkdir -p opencv/build

    # Create a toolchain file with absolute path
    cat > custom_toolchain.cmake << EOF
    # Custom toolchain file to exclude Conda paths

    # Set system compilers
    set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER "/usr/bin/gcc")
    set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "/usr/bin/g++")

    # Set system root directories
    set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH "/usr")
    set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
    set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
    set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
    set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE ONLY)

    # Explicitly exclude Conda paths

        "/workspace/miniconda3/envs/comfystream"
        "/workspace/miniconda3/envs/comfystream/lib"
    )

    # Set RPATH settings
    set(CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH FALSE)
    set(CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH FALSE)
    set(CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH "/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu")
    set(PYTHON_LIBRARY "/workspace/miniconda3/envs/comfystream/lib/")
    set(CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH TRUE)
    EOF

    # Set environment variables for OpenCV
    echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc

    # Build and install OpenCV with CUDA support
    cd opencv/build
    cmake \
      -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../custom_toolchain.cmake \
      -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \
      -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
      -D WITH_CUDA=ON \
      -D WITH_CUDNN=ON \

      -D CUDA_ARCH_LIST="8.0+PTX" \
      -D CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/cuda-${CUDA_VERSION} \
      -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=../../opencv_contrib/modules \
      -D PYTHON3_EXECUTABLE=/workspace/miniconda3/envs/comfystream/bin/python3.11 \
      -D PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/workspace/miniconda3/envs/comfystream/include/python3.11 \
      -D PYTHON_LIBRARY=/workspace/miniconda3/envs/comfystream/lib/libpython3.11.so \
      -D HAVE_opencv_python3=ON \
      -D WITH_NVCUVID=OFF \
      -D WITH_NVCUVENC=OFF \
      ..
    make -j$(nproc)
    make install
    ldconfig
    ```

    After the compilation, you can verify that OpenCV is installed correctly by running:
    ```bash
    python3 -c "import cv2; print(cv2.cuda.getCudaEnabledDeviceCount())"
    ```
    This should output `1` or higher depending on the number of CUDA-enabled devices in your machine if installation was successful.

## Adding the Node

<Note>
  An example upscaling workflow using the Super Resolution node is available
  [here](https://github.com/livepeer/ComfyUI-Stream-Pack/blob/main/examples/workflows/super-res-fscnn-upscale-2x-gpu-api.json).
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the StreamPack Nodes">
    Ensure the [StreamPack](https://github.com/livepeer/ComfyUI-Stream-Pack) custom nodes are installed in your ComfyUI setup. Follow the [installation instructions](/technical/custom-nodes/stream-pack/overview#installation) for a step-by-step guide.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the ComfyUI Graph Editor">
    Right-click on an empty area of the canvas and choose **Add Node**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the Super Resolution Nodes">
    Search for `SuperResolution` under the `StreamPack/` category.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Place it in the Workflow">
    There are two nodes under SuperResolution: `SR Model Loader` and `SR Upscale`. You need both to upscale, so place them on the canvas.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Inputs and Configure Parameters">
    - In `SR Model Loader`, you'll see widgets to select the upscaling model and scale factor.
    - Connect the output of `SR Model Loader` to the input of `SR Upscale`. 
    - In the `SR Upscale` node, toggle the `use CUDA` widget to `true` to enable CUDA acceleration. 
    - Connect an image to the input of `SR Upscale` and a preview node to the output.
  </Step>

</Steps>

The following parameters control how the Super Resolution models behave:

<Accordion title="Tips for Tuning and Best Practices">

- **Select the Model for Upscaling** – Choose the model based on desired upscaling quality and performance; refer to the comparison table above.
- **Scaling Factor Selection** – Consider the required output resolution when choosing the scale factor. A higher scaling factor increases processing time, potentially reducing real-time performance.
- **Using CUDA Acceleration** – While CPU can be used for upscaling, it is significantly slower. Use CUDA acceleration for optimal performance.

</Accordion>

### SR Model Loader Node

<ParamField path="model_type" type="string">
  **Model Type**: Select the upscaling model to use. The quality and performance
  vary by model. Models are downloaded and loaded automatically when selected in
  the canvas. Below is a basic comparison of the models.
</ParamField>

| Model            | Architecture             | Features                      | Best For                     | Speed | Quality |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----- | ------- |

<ParamField path="scale_factor" type="integer">
  **Scale Factor**: Select the upscaling factor. The image will be upscaled by
  this factor. For example, if the input image is `512x512`, the output will be
  `1024x1024` with a scale factor of `2`.
</ParamField>

### SR Upscale Node

<ParamField path="use_CUDA" type="boolean">
  **Use CUDA**: Toggle to `true` to enable CUDA acceleration for upscaling.
</ParamField>

## Strengths and Limitations

While the Super Resolution node offers significant performance benefits compared to other upscaling methods, it also introduces a few trade-offs depending on your use case.

### Strengths

- **Wide suite of supported models** – Option to choose from multiple models (FSRCNN, ESPCN, LapSRN, EDSR) with different quality/speed tradeoffs.
- **Modular Design** – Once a model is loaded, it can be reused across multiple upscaling operations.
- **Fast performance via CUDA** – Configurable CUDA acceleration for optimal performance.
- **Multiple Scale Factors** – Support for 2x, 3x, and 4x upscaling.

### Limitations

- **Setup Complexity** – The node requires a version of OpenCV with CUDA support, which may require additional setup, since the CUDA is only available for NVIDIA GPUs, it will not work on other GPUs.
