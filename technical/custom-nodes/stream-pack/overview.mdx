<Info>
  The ComfyUI-Stream-Pack is in active development and not yet stable. We
  welcome [your
  feedback](https://github.com/livepeer/ComfyUI-Stream-Pack/issues/new) as we
  continue to improve it.
</Info>

The ComfyUI-Stream-Pack provides a [custom node pack](https://github.com/livepeer/ComfyUI-Stream-Pack) for ComfyUI, designed specifically for building real-time video, audio, and data pipelines. These tools enhance output quality, optimize performance, and include benchmarking and profiling features to help users create and refine efficient AI-driven workflows.

## Installation

<Note>
  We are actively working on publishing the StreamPack as a ComfyUI registry
  node. Once available, you will be able to install it directly via the ComfyUI
  Manager for a more streamlined setup process.
</Note>

To use the StreamPack nodes, you need to install the StreamPack repository in your ComfyUI setup.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the custom_nodes directory">
    Open a terminal and navigate to the `custom_nodes` directory in your ComfyUI workspace:
    ```bash
    cd /workspace/ComfyUI/custom_nodes
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone the StreamPack repository">
    Clone the StreamPack repository from GitHub:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/livepeer/ComfyUI-Stream-Pack.git
    cd ComfyUI-Stream-Pack
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Activate your ComfyUI environment and install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    conda activate comfyui
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart ComfyUI">
    Restart your ComfyUI server to load the new nodes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## StreamPack Nodes Overview

<Tip>
  We also recommend **third-party nodes** from other teams that work well with
  real-time workflows. While not maintained by the ComfyStream team, these nodes
  are highly compatible and can enhance your pipelines. Learn more on the
  [Third-Party Nodes](/technical/custom-nodes/third-party-nodes) page.
</Tip>

StreamPack includes a variety of custom nodes grouped into four main categories: **Video Quality Nodes**, which enhance video output; **Performance Nodes**, which optimize real-time workflows; **Benchmarking and Profiling Tools**, which help analyze and refine workflow efficiency; and **Task-Specific Nodes**, which provide specialized functionality for real-time video workflows.

{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}

<Accordion title="Video Quality Nodes">
  - [Feature Bank](/technical/custom-nodes/stream-pack/feature-bank): Improves video quality by using information from previous frames to reduce flickering and ensure smoother transitions.
  - **Super Resolution**: A high-performance upscaling node that uses neural network models like FSRCNN and EDSR to enhance video resolution in real-time, balancing speed and quality.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance Nodes">
  <Note>
    The nodes in this category are still under development and will be released
    soon.

<Accordion title="Task-Specific Nodes">
  - **Facial Mesh**: A MediaPipe Face Mesh node that detects and tracks facial landmarks. It can be used as an additional ControlNet input to enhance facial tracking in real-time workflows.
