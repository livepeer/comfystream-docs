<Note>
  These native nodes are pre-installed with ComfyStream when you install the
  package. You do not need to install them manually. See the [ComfyStream
  Installation Guide](/technical/get-started/install) for details.

The ComfyStream package provides native nodes essential for real-time AI workflows in ComfyUI, handling tasks like converting audio and images into tensors, processing data, and converting tensors back into usable formats. Additionally, the **ComfyStream Toolkit** includes a **StreamPack**, which extends functionality with advanced custom nodes for video, audio, and data workflows. Learn more in the [StreamPack Overview](/technical/custom-nodes/stream-pack/overview) page.

## Input Nodes

ComfyStream provides input nodes to convert media inputs into tensors, enabling AI processing in real-time workflows.

## Output Nodes

ComfyStream provides output nodes to convert tensors back into media formats for real-time streaming.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="SaveAudioTensor">
    Converts audio tensors into audio frames.

    <GitHubFooter url="https://github.com/livepeer/comfystream/blob/main/nodes/audio_utils/save_audio_tensor.py"/>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="SaveTensor">
    Converts image tensors into image frames.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Task-Specific Nodes

Most task-specific nodes are part of the StreamPack, but the ComfyStream package includes a few for example purposes.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="PitchShifter">
    Shifts the pitch of an input audio stream, demonstrating audio
    transformations in real-time workflows.
    <Tip>
      Check out the [Example Workflow](https://github.com/livepeer/comfystream/blob/main/workflows/comfystream/audio-tensor-utils-example-api.json) to see the `PitchShifter` in action.
