    ComfyStream is now in **public alpha**, ready for early adopters to explore real-time AI workflows within ComfyUI. This release focuses on improved stability, a better developer experience, and two major features: a **custom ComfyUI node** and **real-time audio input support**.

    ### Custom Node

    ComfyStream is available as a custom node via the [ComfyUI Node Registry](https://registry.comfy.org/nodes/comfystream), making it easy to integrate into your workflows and unlock real-time streaming capabilities.

    ### Audio Support
